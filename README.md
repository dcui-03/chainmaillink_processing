# Chainmail-Link Mesh Fabrication

In this project, we worked to explore methods for generating FDM-printable chainmail-link objects given a triangle mesh STL as input as part of our Computational Fabrication semester project. The code in this repository contains iterations of the Blender plug-in we developed to generate these links.
